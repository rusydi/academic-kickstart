# Biography

Rusydi Makarim is a PhD student at the [Mathematical Institute](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/mathematics), [University Leiden](https://leiden.edu) and [CWI Cryptology Group](https://projects.cwi.nl/crypto/). His current research interest focuses on the algebraic aspects of cryptanalysis, in particular techniques to solve multivariate quadratic polynomial equations over a finite field. He also has a strong interest in understanding cryptographic aspect of Boolean functions and substitution boxes (S-Box).

Rusydi is an active [SageMath](https://sagemath.org) developer. He is mainly involved in the development of module to analyse cryptographic properties of [Boolean functions](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/cryptography/sage/crypto/boolean_function.html) and [S-Boxes](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/cryptography/sage/crypto/sbox.html). [These are some of the tickets that he has been working on.](https://trac.sagemath.org/query?status=closed&status=needs_info&status=needs_review&status=needs_work&status=new&status=positive_review&author=~Rusydi+H.+Makarim&or&reviewer=~Rusydi+H.+Makarim&group=component&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&order=priority).
