summary = "M4GB is an efficient Groebner basis algorithm designed specifically to maintain tail-reduced polynomials. This C++11 implementation is optimized for dense overdefined system of polynomial equations that represent multivariate public key and digital signature schemes. M4GB and its implementation successfully broke several concrete parameters for multivariate signature algorithm, a potential candidate for post-quantum digital signature scheme. The result is available at https://www.mqchallenge.org."
